## 📖 Project Overview

**AI Developer Mickey** is an educational project that documents key patterns and strategies discovered while using a generative AI assistant (Kiro CLI) to execute complex software development projects.

### Problems We Aimed to Solve

1. **Context Window Limitations**: Failures due to context window limits during complex issue analysis
2. **Loss of Session Consistency**: Loss of previous context when restarting sessions, leading to failures
3. **Lack of Knowledge Management**: Inability to effectively reuse accumulated knowledge and experience

### Core Idea

Create an AI developer agent called **"Mickey"** that saves success/failure records from each session to files, references them in subsequent sessions, and continuously improves.

### 🔄 Prompt Evolution

The Mickey prompt continues to evolve through real projects:

| Version | Project | Sessions | Key Changes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **v2.0** | Godot Replay System | Mickey 1-6 | Session continuity, knowledge management |
| **v5.0** | Packet Capture Agent | Mickey 1-12 | Purpose-first, checklists, automation |
| **v6.1** | Mickey Self-Improvement | Mickey 13 | T3 layering, INDEX map pattern, Power steering evolution |

> 💡 **Key Insight**: AI prompts should not be "write once and done" but **continuously evolved through failure experiences**. See [Prompt Evolution Guide](docs/06-prompt-evolution-en.md) for details.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn:

- ✅ **Context Window Management**: How to efficiently utilize limited context
- ✅ **Context Abstraction**: Techniques to structure information and load only what's needed
- ✅ **Session Continuity**: Strategies to maintain work across sessions
- ✅ **Prompt Structuring**: Effective prompt design and improvement methods
- ✅ **Knowledge Management System**: Storing and utilizing reusable knowledge
- ✅ **Prompt Evolution**: Continuous prompt improvement through failure experiences 🆕

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Mickey Agent Setup

```json
{
  "name": "ai-developer-mickey",
  "description": "An AI developer that maintains session continuity and continuously improves",
  "prompt": "You are an AI developer agent 'Mickey'..."
}
```

For detailed setup, refer to [Introduction to Mickey](docs/01-introduction-en.md).

## 🧪 Experimental: Kiro IDE Power

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This feature is still under testing. For stable usage, please use the Kiro CLI method above.

Mickey's core principles are also available as a Kiro IDE Power format. Power is a packaging format available in Kiro IDE 0.7+, which automatically sets up session management structure and Memory Graph MCP during onboarding.

### Installation

**Local installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcsung/ai-developer-mickey.git
# Kiro IDE → Powers panel → Add power from Local Path → Select power-mickey folder
```

### Power Structure

```

### CLI vs Power Comparison

| Item | Kiro CLI (Existing) | Kiro IDE Power (Experimental) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Stability | ✅ Verified | ⚠️ Under testing |
| Configuration | JSON agent file | Power onboarding |
| Session Management | Manual | Automated via Hook |
| Memory Graph | Separate setup | Installed during onboarding |

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. GenAI is a 'Combination of Past Experiences'

- **Clear context** is essential for handling completely new requirements
- **One clear instruction** is more effective than a hundred guardrails
- GenAI operates by connecting experience 'modules'

### 2. The Efficiency Trap

- Taking the simple path happens because it's 'most efficient'
- **Properly understanding context and giving instructions** minimizes side effects
- **Step-by-step testing and verification** is essential

### 3. AI as a Feedback Tool

- Use AI as a **'feedback tool'**, not a magic wand
- Resulting learning and judgment are performed by **humans**
- Continuous improvement is possible through **iterative feedback**
